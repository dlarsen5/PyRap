# PyRap

Collection of tools built to analyze song lyrics utilizing the Genius API and natural language processing

My overall goal for this project is to statistically analyze song lyrics while also improving my own lyric writing abilities.

Be on the look out for my robo-rapper.

# Getting Started

Just add a `settings.py` file to `genius/` with your Genius API token set as `access_token = KEY` and run the scripts in `generate/` to generate some lines.
